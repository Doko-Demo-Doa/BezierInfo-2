# BezierInfo-2: a dev repository

This is the development repository for ["A Primer on BÃ©zier Curves"](https://pomax.github.io.bezierinfo).

The primer is currently being rewritten from a React application to a pure HTML/CSS/Vanilla-JS tech stack.

React is nice, Webpack is convenient, but there's just very little need to serve the Primer as "a React app". Simply convert the various parts to HTML directly, and then assemble it as "a page" that _just works_, rather than as "an application" that won't even show content without JS enabled.

See https://github.com/Pomax/BezierInfo-2/issues/257 for the current rewrite status
