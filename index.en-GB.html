            Let's start with the good stuff: when we're talking about Bézier
            curves, we're talking about the things that you can see in the
            following graphics. They run from some start point to some end
            point, with their curvature influenced by one or more "intermediate"
            control points. Now, because all the graphics on this page are
            interactive, go manipulate those curves a bit: click-drag the
            points, and see how their shape changes based on what you do.

            These curves are used a lot in computer aided design and computer
            aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications, as well as in graphic
            design programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape,
            GIMP, etc. and in graphic technologies like scalable vector graphics
            (SVG) and OpenType fonts (TTF/OTF). A lot of things use Bézier
            curves, so if you want to learn more about them... prepare to get
            your learn on!

          <h1>So what makes a Bézier Curve?</h1>
          <p>
            Playing with the points for curves may have given you a feel for how
            Bézier curves behave, but what <em>are</em> Bézier curves, really?
            There are two ways to explain what a Bézier curve is, and they turn
            out to be the entirely equivalent, but one of them uses complicated
            maths, and the other uses really simple maths. So... let's start
            with the simple explanation:
          </p>
          <p>
            Bézier curves are the result of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation"
              >linear interpolations</a
            >. That sounds complicated but you've been doing linear
            interpolation since you were very young: any time you had to point
            at something between two other things, you've been applying linear
            interpolation. It's simply "picking a point between two points".
          </p>
          <p>
            If we know the distance between those two points, and we want a new
            point that is, say, 20% the distance away from the first point (and
            thus 80% the distance away from the second point) then we can
            compute that really easily:
          </p>
          <img
            className="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0ee04e4056391f945c1c21c1174a03b5.svg"
            width="507px"
            height="103px"
          />
          <p>
            So let's look at that in action: the following graphic is
            interactive in that you can use your up and down arrow keys to
            increase or decrease the interpolation ratio, to see what happens.
            We start with three points, which gives us two lines. Linear
            interpolation over those lines gives us two points, between which we
            can again perform linear interpolation, yielding a single point. And
            that point —and all points we can form in this way for all ratios
            taken together— form our Bézier curve:
          </p>
          <graphics-element
            title="Linear Interpolation leading to Bézier curves"
            width="200"
            height="200"
            src="./chapters/whatis/interpolation.js"
          >
            <fallback-image>
              <img src="./chapters/whatis/interpolation.png" />
              <span>Scripts are disabled. Showing fallback image.</span>
            </fallback-image>
          </graphics-element>

          <p>And that brings us to the complicated maths: calculus.</p>
          <p>
            While it doesn't look like that's what we've just done, we actually
            just drew a quadratic curve, in steps, rather than in a single go.
            One of the fascinating parts about Bézier curves is that they can
            both be described in terms of polynomial functions, as well as in
            terms of very simple interpolations of interpolations of [...].
            That, in turn, means we can look at what these curves can do based
            on both "real maths" (by examining the functions, their derivatives,
            and all that stuff), as well as by looking at the "mechanical"
            composition (which tells us, for instance, that a curve will never
            extend beyond the points we used to construct it).
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's start looking at Bézier curves a bit more in depth: their
            mathematical expressions, the properties we can derive from them,
            and the various things we can do to, and with, Bézier curves.
