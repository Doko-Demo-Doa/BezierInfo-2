          <h1>Preface</h1>
          <p>
            In order to draw things in 2D, we usually rely on lines, which
            typically get classified into two categories: straight lines, and
            curves. The first of these are as easy to draw as they are easy to
            make a computer draw. Give a computer the first and last point in
            the line, and BAM! straight line. No questions asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curves, however, are a much bigger problem. While we can draw curves
            with ridiculous ease freehand, computers are a bit handicapped in
            that they can't draw curves unless there is a mathematical function
            that describes how it should be drawn. In fact, they even need this
            for straight lines, but the function is ridiculously easy, so we
            tend to ignore that as far as computers are concerned; all lines are
            "functions", regardless of whether they're straight or curves.
            However, that does mean that we need to come up with fast-to-compute
            functions that lead to nice looking curves on a computer. There are
            a number of these, and in this article we'll focus on a particular
            function that has received quite a bit of attention and is used in
            pretty much anything that can draw curves: Bézier curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're named after
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier"
              >Pierre Bézier</a
            >, who is principally responsible for making them known to the world
            as a curve well-suited for design work (publishing his
            investigations in 1962 while working for Renault), although he was
            not the first, or only one, to "invent" these type of curves. One
            might be tempted to say that the mathematician
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_de_Casteljau"
              >Paul de Casteljau</a
            >
            was first, as he began investigating the nature of these curves in
            1959 while working at Citroën, and came up with a really elegant way
            of figuring out how to draw them. However, de Casteljau did not
            publish his work, making the question "who was first" hard to answer
            in any absolute sense. Or is it? Bézier curves are, at their core,
            "Bernstein polynomials", a family of mathematical functions
            investigated by
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Natanovich_Bernstein"
              >Sergei Natanovich Bernstein</a
            >, whose publications on them date back at least as far as 1912.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, that's mostly trivia, what you are more likely to care about
            is that these curves are handy: you can link up multiple Bézier
            curves so that the combination looks like a single curve. If you've
            ever drawn Photoshop "paths" or worked with vector drawing programs
            like Flash, Illustrator or Inkscape, those curves you've been
            drawing are Bézier curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if you need to program them yourself? What are the
            pitfalls? How do you draw them? What are the bounding boxes, how do
            you determine intersections, how can you extrude a curve, in short:
            how do you do everything that you might want when you do with these
            curves? That's what this page is for. Prepare to be mathed!

            ## PS: buy me a coffee?

            <p>
              If you enjoyed this book enough to print it out, you might be
              wondering if there is some way to give something back. To answer
              that question: you can always buy me a coffee, however-much a
              coffee is where you live, or if you want to pay a fair price for
              this book, you can buy me a really expensive coffee =)
            </p>
            <p>
              This book has grown over the years from a short primer to a 100+
              print-page-equivalent ebook on the subject of Bézier curves, and a
              lot of coffee went into the making of it. I don't regret a minute
              I spent on writing it, but I can always do with some more coffee
              to keep on writing! Please visit
              <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo"
                >https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo</a
              >
              and click on the link in the online preface to donate some coffee
              money.

            <h2>Note: virtually all Bézier graphics are interactive.</h2>
            <p>
              This page uses interactive examples, relying heavily on
              <a href="http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs">Bezier.js</a>, as well
              as maths formulae which are typeset into SVG using the
              <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/xetex">XeLaTeX</a> typesetting
              system and
              <a href="https://github.com/dawbarton/pdf2svg">pdf2svg</a> by
              <a href="http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/">David Barton</a>. The

            <h2>This book is open source.</h2>
            <p>
              This book is an open source software project, and lives on two
              github repositories. The first is
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/bezierinfo"
                >https://github.com/pomax/bezierinfo</a
              >
              and is the purely-for-presentation version you are viewing right
              now. The other repository is
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2"
                >https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2</a
              >, which is the development version, housing all the HTML,
              JavaScript, and CSS. You can fork either of these, and pretty much
              do with them as you please, except for passing it off as your own
              work wholesale, of course =)
            </p>
            <h2>How complicated is the maths going to be?</h2>
            <p>
              Most of the mathematics in this Primer are early high school
              maths. If you understand basic arithmetic, and you know how to
              read English, you should be able to get by just fine. There will
              at times be <em>far</em> more complicated maths, but if you don't
              feel like digesting them, you can safely skip over them by either
              skipping over the "detail boxes" in section or by just jumping to
              the end of a section with maths that looks too involving. The end
              of sections typically simply list the conclusions so you can just
              work with those values directly.
            </p>
            <h2>Questions, comments:</h2>
            <p>
              If you have suggestions for new sections, hit up the
              <a href="https://github.com/pomax/BezierInfo-2/issues"
                >Github issue tracker</a
              >
              (also reachable from the repo linked to in the upper right). If
              you have questions about the material, there's currently no
              comment section while I'm doing the rewrite, but you can use the
              issue tracker for that as well. Once the rewrite is done, I'll add
              a general comment section back in, and maybe a more topical
              "select this section of text and hit the 'question' button to ask
              a question about it" system. We'll see.

          <p>
            Let's start with the good stuff: when we're talking about Bézier
            curves, we're talking about the things that you can see in the
            following graphics. They run from some start point to some end
            point, with their curvature influenced by one or more "intermediate"
            control points. Now, because all the graphics on this page are
            interactive, go manipulate those curves a bit: click-drag the
            points, and see how their shape changes based on what you do.

            These curves are used a lot in computer aided design and computer
            aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications, as well as in graphic
            design programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape,
            GIMP, etc. and in graphic technologies like scalable vector graphics
            (SVG) and OpenType fonts (TTF/OTF). A lot of things use Bézier
            curves, so if you want to learn more about them... prepare to get
            your learn on!

          <h1>So what makes a Bézier Curve?</h1>
          <p>
            Playing with the points for curves may have given you a feel for how
            Bézier curves behave, but what <em>are</em> Bézier curves, really?
            There are two ways to explain what a Bézier curve is, and they turn
            out to be the entirely equivalent, but one of them uses complicated
            maths, and the other uses really simple maths. So... let's start
            with the simple explanation:
          </p>
          <p>
            Bézier curves are the result of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation"
              >linear interpolations</a
            >. That sounds complicated but you've been doing linear
            interpolation since you were very young: any time you had to point
            at something between two other things, you've been applying linear
            interpolation. It's simply "picking a point between two points".
          </p>
          <p>
            If we know the distance between those two points, and we want a new
            point that is, say, 20% the distance away from the first point (and
            thus 80% the distance away from the second point) then we can
            compute that really easily:
          </p>
          <img
            className="LaTeX SVG"
            src="images/latex/0ee04e4056391f945c1c21c1174a03b5.svg"
            width="507px"
            height="103px"
          />
          <p>
            So let's look at that in action: the following graphic is
            interactive in that you can use your up and down arrow keys to
            increase or decrease the interpolation ratio, to see what happens.
            We start with three points, which gives us two lines. Linear
            interpolation over those lines gives us two points, between which we
            can again perform linear interpolation, yielding a single point. And
            that point —and all points we can form in this way for all ratios
            taken together— form our Bézier curve:
          </p>

            height="275"
            src="./chapters/whatis/interpolation.js"
          >
            <fallback-image>
              <img
                src="./chapters/whatis/interpolation.png"

                height="275"

          <p>And that brings us to the complicated maths: calculus.</p>
          <p>
            While it doesn't look like that's what we've just done, we actually
            just drew a quadratic curve, in steps, rather than in a single go.
            One of the fascinating parts about Bézier curves is that they can
            both be described in terms of polynomial functions, as well as in
            terms of very simple interpolations of interpolations of [...].
            That, in turn, means we can look at what these curves can do based
            on both "real maths" (by examining the functions, their derivatives,
            and all that stuff), as well as by looking at the "mechanical"
            composition (which tells us, for instance, that a curve will never
            extend beyond the points we used to construct it).
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's start looking at Bézier curves a bit more in depth: their
            mathematical expressions, the properties we can derive from them,
            and the various things we can do to, and with, Bézier curves.
